# Offline mode is going places.

Offline mode/cracked mode is now completely removed from the launcher. You can still create offline account, but you'll not be able to play Minecraft. For that you'll still need a Microsoft account that has purchased Minecraft Java Edition.

**Pojavlauncher does't support any type of piracy or related action.**
